# HOW TO JOIN LIGMA SMP
The great Ligma SMP. A dedicated modded Fabric server with custom worldgen and way harder difficulty to spice up the Minecraft experience. Beginners might find it difficult to play in the server so it is recommended to play with someone experienced while on the server!

## REQUIREMENTS
- Fabric 1.20.1
- The Ligma Modpack (see below)

## INSTALLING THE LIGMA MODPACK
- Download the [tar.xz file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fdKNwG35oriEzn0wgeep2OI-q7kUexH8/view?usp=sharing)
- Extract the contents of `ligma-modpack/mods` into the `.minecraft/mods` folder of your minecraft profile. The `.jar` files must be an immidiate child of the `.minecraft/mods` folder or else Minecraft won't load them.
- Extract and overwrite the contents of `ligma-modpack/config` into the `.minecraft/config`. You must replace the conflicting files or the modpack update checker won't properly function.
- You can now join through the IP below.
